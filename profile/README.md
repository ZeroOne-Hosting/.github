# ZeroOne Hosting  

Ten years ago, in a town remembered for Mount St. Helens ashfall, a Denny’s that never closes, and the mighty Cowlitz Black Bears, one man was sentenced — by the voices in his head — to build a Tier IV hyperscale rack facility in his garage.

He promptly escaped to the Kelso underground, chasing down server and networking deals from eBay and Craigslist.

Today, still wanted by at least three employers, he survives on Taco Bell packets and the battery of an electric Hyundai Kona.

If three nines are enough, if rebooting an entire rack just to install vim sounds reasonable, and if a datacenter lashed together with free vendor pens and duct tape doesn’t scare you…

Maybe you can host your shit on ZeroOne.

Witnesses claim Jeff from Craft Computing once drove past, shook his head, and muttered: “This is not best practice.”

ZeroOne Hosting is the garage-born shrine to uptime, entropy, and late-night Taco Bell runs. Conceived as a reminder that not all datacenters are fortresses — some are just garages with questionable power, northwestern reptiles, and duct-taped racks.  

Where others promise perfection, ZeroOne embraces reality: uptime is a prayer, not a guarantee.
