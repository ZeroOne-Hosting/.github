# ZeroOne Hosting  

**“Three nines are enough.”**  

ZeroOne Hosting is the garage-born shrine to uptime, entropy, and late-night Taco Bell runs. Conceived in Kelso, Washington, after a man’s fortune was devoured by cabling contractors, ZeroOne endures as a reminder that not all datacenters are fortresses — some are garages with questionable power, northwestern reptiles, and duct-taped racks.  

Where others promise perfection, ZeroOne embraces reality: uptime is a prayer, not a guarantee.

## Philosophy  

> *“Mock not the garage-born shrine.  
> For though its amps flicker and its floors creak,  
> it whispers a lesson we all must heed:  
> uptime is a prayer, not a promise.”*  

ZeroOne Hosting exists to remind us all:  
- Every server is mortal.  
- Every rack will someday fall silent.  
- But until then — we host.
