# ZeroOne Hosting  

10 years ago in a town famous for Mount St. Helens ashfall, a Denny’s that never closes, and the Cowlitz Black Bears baseball team, one man was sentenced to build a Tier IV hyperscale high-density rack facility in his garage. His wealth promptly escaped to the accounts of the local area underground cabling contractors. 

Today still wanted by at least three employers, he survives on Taco Bell and an Electric Hyundai Kona.

If three nines are enough, If rebooting an entire rack to install vim is ok, and if a datacenter run on free promotional pens from vendor confernces doesn't bother you, maybe you can host your shit on ZeroOne

ZeroOne Hosting is the garage-born shrine to uptime, entropy, and late-night Taco Bell runs. Conceived in Kelso, Washington, after a man’s fortune was devoured by cabling contractors, ZeroOne endures as a reminder that not all datacenters are fortresses — some are garages with questionable power, northwestern reptiles, and duct-taped racks.  

Where others promise perfection, ZeroOne embraces reality: uptime is a prayer, not a guarantee.
