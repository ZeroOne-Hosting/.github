# ZeroOne Hosting  

**“Three nines are enough.”**  

ZeroOne Hosting is the garage-born shrine to uptime, entropy, and late-night Taco Bell runs. Conceived in Kelso, Washington, after a man’s fortune was devoured by cabling contractors, ZeroOne endures as a reminder that not all datacenters are fortresses — some are garages with questionable power, northwestern reptiles, and duct-taped racks.  

Where others promise perfection, ZeroOne embraces reality: uptime is a prayer, not a guarantee.
